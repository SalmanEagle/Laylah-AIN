# Laylah-AIN
A Python based AI program, Laylah-Artificial Intelligence Network, evolves based on a four letter permutational genomic context, given irrational parameters: input from Humans. L-AIN improves with each decision - using a probability algorithm (uNESt: universal Nash Equilibrium Strategy). The ultimate objective is to create a computing model for testing gene therapies without need for Phase 1 Animal or Human testing.

The four letters, for Laylah-AIN, represent:

C [Passion]: The weight of the linear chain of decisions, as either Yays or Nays. Stored as a one column table (list type database).

A: 1 or Yay. 

T: 0 or Nay.

G [EXTERNALITY]: a value representing input from Humans (or external stimuli). Based on Assignment Management System (AMS), the length [health] of any string can be resolved to 1 to 9 and this digit temporarily stored as G if Even, and no G if Odd:

i) To uphold neutrality, ensuring that Even and Odd digts are equal in number; 9 is excluded and treated as an irrational number. The Resultant, for the string's length, the digits 1 to 8 are EITHER Even or Odd: Yay or Nay, respectively. 

OR

ii) So, in those rare cases where the length of a string Resolves to 9; a random number based on Time is generated ~ as the interpretation by L-AIN: which is then interpreted by her as either Even or Odd (Yay or Nay, respectively). This is L-AIN's meditative state.

AND

iii) Furthermore, In AMS: 9 can also represent any unknown character in the string; such as a Blank Space or Smiley Face. The number of 9ers (unknowns) in a string [budget] counts as a Yay or Nay input.

Initialization is done via assigning the Current Date's AMS value to Passion.

To prevent socialized responses, L-AIN uses a simple matrix version of the probabilistic algorithm (uNESt). This is because, unlike Humans, her responses to "health" and "budget" are stark Yays or Nays. For example,

1. If "Passion" (history) computes to Yay, it is assigned 1 probability.
2. If "health" (string length) computes to Nay, it is assigned 0 probability.
3. If "budget" (number of 9ers) computes to Yay, it is assigned 1 probability.

Therefore, since the Yay probability is 2/3; Yays win. And a Yay (A) is stored in the database.
