# Laylah-AIN
A Python based AI program, Laylah-Artificial Intelligence Network, evolves based on a four letter permutational genomic context, given irrational parameters: input from Humans. L-AIN evolves with each decision - using a probability algorithm (uNESt: universal Nash Equilibrium Strategy). The ultimate objective is to create a computing model for testing gene therapies without need for stage one animal or human testing.

The four letters, for Laylah-AIN, represent:
C: 1.
A: 0.
T: Storage in a table (database).
G: a Variable, input from Humans (or external stimuli).
