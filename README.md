# Laylah-AIN
A Python based AI program, Laylah-Artificial Intelligence Network, evolves based on a four letter permutational genomic context, given irrational parameters: input from Humans. L-AIN improves with each decision - using a probability algorithm (uNESt: universal Nash Equilibrium Strategy). The ultimate objective is to create a computing model for testing gene therapies without need for Phase 1 animal or human testing.

The four letters, for Laylah-AIN, represent:

C [Passion]: The weight of the linear chain of decisions, as either Yays or Nays. Stored as a one column table (list type database).

A [health]: 1 or Yay. 

T [budget]: 0 or Nay.

G [EXTERNALITY]: a variable, input from Humans (or external stimuli). Based on Assignment Management System, all strings can be resolved to 0 to 9 (which include EITHER Even or Odd numbers. Yays or Nays, respectively).
